# Flutter Urovo RFID

A Flutter plugin that wraps Urovo’s Android RFID SDK, providing a Dart API to
power on/off the RFID module, start/stop inventory and stream tag data to
Flutter applications.

This plugin is derived from Urovo’s sample `Urovo-RFID-Demo` application and
follows the standard Flutter plugin layout generated by
`flutter create --template=plugin`.

## Features

* Power on/off and connect to the Urovo RFID reader
* Start and stop continuous inventory scanning
* Perform single inventory scans
* Retrieve firmware version
* Receive tag events (EPC, TID, RSSI) via a broadcast stream

## Usage

Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_urovo_rfid:
    path: ../flutter_urovo_rfid
```

Import the library and use the static methods:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_urovo_rfid/flutter_urovo_rfid.dart';

void initReader() async {
  // Power on and connect
  final state = await FlutterUrovoRfid.openRfid();
  print('RFID state: \$state');

  // Listen to tag events
  FlutterUrovoRfid.scanStream.listen((event) {
    final epc = event['epc'];
    final tid = event['tid'];
    final rssi = event['rssi'];
    print('Tag: EPC=\$epc TID=\$tid RSSI=\$rssi');
  });
}

void startScanning() async {
  await FlutterUrovoRfid.startReading();
}

void stopScanning() async {
  await FlutterUrovoRfid.stopReading();
}

void disposeReader() async {
  await FlutterUrovoRfid.closeRfid();
}

```

See the example app in `example/` for a complete demonstration.

## Android Setup

This plugin depends on the proprietary Urovo RFID SDK.  To compile and run
successfully, you must obtain the SDK JAR/AAR files from Urovo and place them
into the plugin’s `android/src/main/libs` directory (create it if it doesn’t
exist).  The Gradle script is configured to include any `.jar` or `.aar` files
found there.

Because the Urovo SDK uses reflection and dynamic loading, ProGuard rules have
been provided in `android/proguard-rules.pro` to preserve required classes. If
you enable code shrinking, make sure these rules are applied.
